* Business Valuation: Calculating the Value of a Company
    * business valuation? = the worth of a business
    * how much it would cost to purchase the business
* There are three approaches
    1. asset approach
        * calculates all the assets and liabilities of a company in its valuation
        * assets - liabilities
        * $4 million in assets, $2 million in liabilities -> $2 million of value
    2. market approach
        * values a business according to the stock market
        * stock market per share of similar company * total number of shares the similar company has = company value
        * $10-$13 per share, 10,000 shares -> value will be between $100,000 - $130,000
    3. income approach
        * to divide the annual earnings by the capitalization rate
        * capitalization rate = the value used to convert a company's annual earnings to its company value
