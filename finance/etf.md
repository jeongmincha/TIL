## Tracking error & Disparity rate -> how to find a good ETF
* Instead of buying too many investment goods, we can buy ETF
* ex. When you are on a diet, you need to keep your food combination and a certain total calories.
    * What if one pill satisfies all the nutrients without preparing all the food?
    * That pill is similar to the concept of ETF.
* What does it mean for ETFs to have large tracking errors? (추적 오차)
    * ex. turns out that the pill doesn't follow the prescribed nutritional content and lacks the total calories. 
    * Like this, ETFs with large tracking errors doesn't follow the promised combination of investment goods.
    * ex. S&P500 increases by 5% -> but an ETF following it doesn't increases by 5%. -> tracking errors = large
* ETFs of the same base products have different prices
    * If there is a significant difference between ETF's price and its intrinsic value (calculated from the combination of the underlying products), we say that the ETF has a large disparity rate. (괴리율)
    * The price of ETF is determined by its supply and demand. Therefore, the actual intrinsic value and price may be different.
